## 📱 How It Works:

1. Someone messages your WhatsApp
2. AI generates a reply
3. You get notification on Telegram with:
   - Their message
   - AI suggested reply
   - [✅ Approve] or [🎤 Record Own] buttons
4. Everything logs to Google Sheets
5. Reply gets sent to WhatsApp

---

## 🧪 Test It:

1. Start both services (bridge + bot)
2. Send a test message to your WhatsApp from another phone
3. Check your Telegram - you should see the notification!
4. Click "Approve" to send the AI reply
5. Check Google Sheets - message should be logged

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting:

**"Failed to send message"**
- Make sure WhatsApp bridge is running on port 8080

**"Google Sheets error"**
- Did you share the sheet with the service account email?
- Is the Sheet ID correct in config.py?

**"Telegram not receiving"**
- Send `/start` to your bot on Telegram first
- Check bot token and chat ID in config.py

**"OpenAI error"**
- Verify API key is valid
- Check you have credits in OpenAI account
